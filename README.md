A battleship-style developed with Vue.js in the frontend and Java 8 with Spring Boot and Gradle for the backend. The game is fully playable, including login, registration, joining existing matches, and a scoring system that keeps track of the player's win/loss history. It was not designed with mobile in mind. For that reason, it is best viewed on a larger screen. I intend to add mobile-scaling in the near future.

The game will not officially start until both players have joined the match.

Salvo is not intended for commercial use, but simply for use as a learning tool while developing my skills in Java.
